# Cosmopilot

Made from two Ardupilot + Cosmoclench (Pick and place robot competetion). As the name suggest it is similar to ardupilot but for esp32 and very barebones, basically takes commands from user either from uart (via an RF receiver) or from BLE or Wi-Fi, then using those control a very simple RC robot.
